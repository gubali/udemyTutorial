1) Cloud Computing:  ====>
on demand delivery of computer power,db,storage application
pay as you go pricing

2) deloyment model
private Cloud
public Cloud
Hybrid

CAPEX: Capotal expenses
OPEX: OPerational Expense

3) Type of cloud Computing
  Iaas: Infrastructure as a Services (provice n/w, data stoarge etc)
   like: Ec2 on AWS

  Paas: Plateform as service
     Remove the need of your organization to manage the underlying Infrastructure
    Focus on the deployment  and manage of your application
    like: Elastic beanstalk in AWS

Saas:Software as service
     completed prpoduct run and manage by serice provider.
     like: Rekignition for ML, Zoom, DropBox
========================================================
On premises: Manage everything
     Application+ Data + Runtime + Midleware + Os + Virtualization + Servers + Storage + Networking

Iaas: Application+ Data + Runtime + Midleware + Os
Paas: Plateform as aservice: Application+ Data
Saas: everyting manage by aws ( Application+ Data + Runtime + Midleware + Os + Virtualization + Servers + Storage + Networking)

Pricing:
Compute: PAy for compute time
Stoarge: Pay for data stored in the cloud
Data taransfer OUT of cloud

========================================================
10) AWS overview
   2004: pulicly laucnhed.

AWS Global Infrastructure:
 - Region (Cluster of data Center) min is 3 and max is 6 
 - Avalibility zone ( discreate data center with redundant data center)
 - Data center
 - Edge  loation/ point of presense

 Edge location:
 216 points of presense

 11) AWS region scoped:
  - Amazon EC2 IA (Identity as a service)
  - Elastic beanstalk
  - Lambda (Function as a service)
  - Rekignition (Software as a service)
  
 12) Tour of the console & Service: 
   
Section 4: IAM (Identity and access managemnt)
riePolicies: user or group can be assign JSON docuemnt called Policies + define Policies
 

=============== EBS =============

Elastic block stored
persist data

volume: can not attache a to b
link with avalability zones

Hands on

EBS snapshot: backup

#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum instal -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
echo "<h1>Hello from $(hostname -f)</h1>"

Ec2 image builder:
create virtual machine
 * An image recipe is a document that defines the components to be applied to the base images to create the desired configuration for the output image. After a recipe has been created, it cannot be modified. A new version must be created in order to change components.

EFS: Elastic File system
NFS: Network file system
work only linux ec2 in multi-AZ
EFS-IA: RFS Irfrequent access

Fsx = 3rd party high performance file system on aws


=====> Section 7: ELB & ASG - Elastic Load Balancing & Auto Scaling Groups

scalibility: handle greater loads

types: vertical 
  1- increae size the insatnces  (up and down)
  exp: call center

  2-  horizontal(elasticity)
   - increasing the number of insatnces
   - distributed systems

hogh avalibility: horizontal Scaling
  - ruuning application in atleat 2 zone (multi AZ)

  Scalibility: larger  load by making hardware stronger (scale up)
  
  Elasticity: some auto scaling system can scale based on the laod.
  cloud friendly

  Agility: reduce time to thoswe resource avaliable.


Load balancing: 
forward internet tarffic to multiple servers  downstream

 Type of load balencer:
 - application load balancer => ALB(HTTP/HTTPs - layer 7)
 - Network load baalncer ultra high perodrmance - TCP- layer 4
 - Classisc load balancer



Auto scaling Group:


=======> S2 =========>

infinitely storage

use case:
 - backup and staoarge
 - disaster recovry
 - archive

 object: files
 bucket: directories
 buckert: regional level

 size object: 5TB(5000GB)
 5GB: multi part upload

 s3 security:
  1- User based 
    : IAM
 2- Resource based 
  - buket policies
  - object access control list
  - bucket access control list
  3- Encryption
