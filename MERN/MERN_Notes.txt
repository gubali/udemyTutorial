Company MERN Program ================> Target to get certificate

1) Modules
2) Components
3) Tempaltes
4) Data binding
5) Meta Data
6) Diretcives
7) Services

1) command to generate angular

ng new project_name

folder structure =============>
e2e: test script for testing your application
node_modules: all npm package 
dist: when build project_name
packgage.json: which lib is installed.
tsconfig: compiler options
@Module decoration: 
polyfill: browser compatubility

style.css: global style
css: style
html:view UI
ts:define hevaviour of application
spec.ts: test bed


Angualr architectre:
Module:  

** Basic building block:

Modules
 - Group of component,Diretcives, pipes, services
 - if application is complex add feature Modules

Components
 - component which used to render a view and programs the behaviour
 - component = .ts + html + .spec.ts + css

Tempaltes
 - inline templates: UI just showing header/footer simple set of element 
 - separate .html

 Meta data: Tell angular how to process a class

Data binding
Meta data
Diretcives
Service 
Services
Depedency injenction


** Type Script
Transpilling: .ts to convert into js calles Transpilling.

Two way to change typescript to js.
 1) Transpile to java script into browser itself.
 2) Transpile to js  before shipping  to browser

 feature: Object oriented, class interface , implement, extends
Tupe: Can hold diff type of values

*AOT 
ng serve = Build(bundling all the application inoto one file) + Deploye

JIT (Just In Time) Development MOde by developer
 -Dynamic translation or run time compilation during the execution of the programs
 a . use html, ts, css to develop application
 b. use ng build to build source code into bundle 

AOT(Ahead of time) Production deployment
 - converting high level code into native m/c code b4 browser download and run.
 - faster rendering
 - smaller angualr framework
 - detect template error earlier
 - Better security
 - ng build --prod build sorce code bundles
 AOT build project flow = Code analysis + code generation + template type checking
